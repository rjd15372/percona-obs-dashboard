# PPG OBS Dashboard

A real-time build monitoring dashboard for PPG packages on the Open Build Service.
The dashboard polls OBS on a schedule and consumes RabbitMQ build events, stores state in SQLite, and renders a live board view with per-package rollup states and a build event log.

## What you get

- Package cards showing live rollup state (building, failed, succeeded, published) across all PPG OBS projects.
- Per-target build event log: build started, succeeded, failed, published — filterable by tag and time window.
- Artifacts view — binary package download links and container image pull commands, browsable by version, repo, and arch; covers dev builds, releases, and PRs.
- Tag-based filtering (RPM, DEB, container) and version selector.
- PR build tracking: dedicated board context per OBS PR branch.
- SSE-based live updates — cards and event log update in real time without a page refresh.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone <repo-url> obs-dashboard
cd obs-dashboard

cp .env.example .env     # add OBS credentials (required)

task dev                 # http://localhost:4000
```

`task dev` builds and starts both the Go backend and the Vite dev server in Docker.
The frontend proxies API calls to the backend, so only `:4000` needs to be open.

## Configuration

Secrets and runtime settings live in `.env`. An optional `config.yaml` provides the
same knobs in YAML form — environment variables always take precedence.

### `.env`

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OBS_USERNAME` | *(required)* | OBS account username |
| `OBS_PASSWORD` | *(required)* | OBS account password |
| `OBS_BASE_URL` | `https://api.opensuse.org` | OBS API base URL |
| `MQ_URL` | `amqps://opensuse:opensuse@rabbit.opensuse.org:5671/` | RabbitMQ connection URL |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `2m` | How often the poller fetches OBS build results |
| `DB_PATH` | `/data/obsboard.db` | SQLite database path (inside the container) |
| `EVENT_RETENTION` | `7d` | How long build events are kept |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `4000` | Port the backend listens on |

Copy `.env.example` for a pre-filled template.

### `config.yaml` (optional)

`config.yaml.example` shows the equivalent YAML structure. Useful if you prefer
file-based config or need to set fields not exposed as env vars (e.g. `obs_root`).
The file is read on startup; environment variables override any value it contains.

## Development

```sh
task dev          # start backend (:4000) + Vite dev server (:5173), hot reload
task down         # stop the development stack
```

The working tree is bind-mounted into the frontend container, so edits appear
live. Backend changes require a container rebuild (`task down && task dev`).

## Production

```sh
task redeploy     # (re)build and (re)start the production stack
task prod-logs    # tail production logs
task down-prod    # stop the production stack
```

The production build compiles the frontend into static assets and embeds them
in a single Go binary inside a minimal Alpine image. Persistent state lives in
`./data` (bind-mounted into the container).

### Upgrading to multi-instance

The first start of a multi-instance build migrates the SQLite database in
place: it strips the `<obs_root>:` prefix from every stored project name
(`isv:percona:ppg:17` → `ppg:17`) and stamps the legacy instance on stored
build targets and target events. The migration runs once and cannot be undone
by an older binary, which would re-insert root-prefixed rows next to the
migrated ones.

- **Before rolling out**, stop the stack and back up the database
  (`data/obsboard.db`, i.e. `DB_PATH` on the host).
- **To roll back**, stop the stack, restore that backup, and start the older
  image.
